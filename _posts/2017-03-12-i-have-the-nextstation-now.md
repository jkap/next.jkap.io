great news y'all: i have a NeXTstation in my possession

it didn't come with anything so i went ahead and purchased a sound box, non-adb keyboard and mouse, and a video cable with VGA out for connecting to a regular display.

my first goal is going to be getting video out, then booting from a floppy, then i'm going to get a SCSI -> SD adapter and external SCSI CD drive to actually install NeXTSTEP on it.

anyway here's some pictures
