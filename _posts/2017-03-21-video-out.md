i got video out!!!! i got input!!!!! the system test fails because there isn't a hard drive, but i've ordered a scsi2sd that will fix that problem. once i get that, i'll be able to netboot into an os, and once i get in an external scsi cd rom drive, i'll be able to install NeXTstep back on it!

i'm extremely happy with the progress i've made on this so far and i'm really excited to keep making progress!!! everything is going very well and i'm very excited!!

NEXT GOAL: write one of these posts *from the NeXTstation*
